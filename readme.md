# Lapha

Lapha is remote movement/motion detection application.

## About

It allows users to monitor their environment using their device as a security camera without the internet. This goal was achieved by implementing the necessary features that allow the user to stream video feeds directly from their device to another device directly over a local network or Wi-Fi without requiring internet access by using the streaming device as a local WebRTC server, this ensures that every processing is done within the local application without a third-party server.

other features to the language.
- WebRTC: WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) is a browser-based API for
enabling real-time communication (audio, video, and data) between web browsers. WebSocket will be used to enable two-way communication between the Capture Device the Guardian Device.
